# C Programming I Challenges

## 1. Stdio Challenge

Write a program that asks the user for their name and their favorite number. Then, print a message to the console that says "Hello, [name]! Your favorite number is [number]."

## 2. Stdlib Challenge

Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The program should then ask the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high, the program should print "Too high!". If the user's guess is too low, the program should print "Too low!". If the user guesses the number correctly, the program should print "You got it!".

## 3. Math Challenge

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. The program should then print the square root of the number. The program should also ask the user to enter a float number and the program should round the float number and print it.

## 4. File Handling Challenge

Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. The program should then write the sentence to a file called "sentence.txt". After writing to the file, the program should read the sentence from the file and print it to the console.

## 5. Binary Challenge

Write a program that asks the user to enter a decimal number. The program should then convert the decimal number to binary and print the binary representation.

## 6. Encryption Challenge

Write a program that asks the user to enter a message and a key. The program should then encrypt the message using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## 7. Decryption Challenge

Write a program that asks the user to enter a message and a key. The program should then decrypt the message using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
