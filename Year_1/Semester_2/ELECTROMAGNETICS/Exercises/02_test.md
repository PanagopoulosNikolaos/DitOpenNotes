### **Part A: Theory Questions**

**1. Comparison of Electrostatic and Magnetostatic Fields:**
Describe the primary sources for electrostatic fields and magnetostatic fields. Explain the fundamental difference between the field lines of each field (i.e., are they open or closed?), and relate this difference to Gauss's Law for electricity and for magnetism.

**2. Conductors and Dielectrics in an Electric Field:**
a) What happens to free charges within a conducting material when it is placed in an external static electric field? Describe the resulting electric field inside the conductor once electrostatic equilibrium is reached.
b) Explain the phenomenon of electric polarization in a dielectric material. What is the effect of polarization on the net electric field inside the dielectric?

### **Part B: Exercises**

**3. Plane Electromagnetic Wave:**
The magnetic field of a sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave propagating in a vacuum is given by the equation:
**B** = (8.25 x 10⁻⁹ T) cos(kz + 2.70 x 10¹⁵ t) **î**

a) In which direction is the wave propagating?
b) Find the frequency (f) and the wavelength (λ) of the wave.
c) Write the corresponding equation for the electric field **E**.
d) Calculate the intensity (I) of the wave.

**4. Electrostatic Force:**
Three point charges are placed on the x-axis:
*   q₁ = +4.0 μC is at x = 0 m.
*   q₂ = -2.0 μC is at x = 3.0 m.
*   q₃ = +6.0 μC is at x = 5.0 m.

Calculate the magnitude and direction of the net electrostatic force exerted on charge q₂.

**5. Magnetic Field from a Current:**
A long, straight electrical wire carries a constant current of I = 20 A. Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field (B) at a perpendicular distance r = 5.0 cm from the center of the wire.

**6. Parallel-Plate Capacitor with Dielectric:**
A parallel-plate capacitor has a plate area of A = 150 cm² and a plate separation of d = 2.0 mm. The space between the plates is completely filled with a dielectric material with a dielectric constant κ = 3.5. A potential difference of V = 24 V is applied across the plates.

a) What is the capacitance (C) of the capacitor?
b) How much charge (Q) is stored on the plates?
c) What is the magnitude of the electric field (E) between the plates?

**7. Reflection and Refraction:**
A beam of light travels from glass (n₁ = 1.52) into water (n₂ = 1.33). The angle of incidence is θ₁ = 35°.

a) Will the light ray be refracted into the water? Justify your answer by calculating the critical angle for the glass-water interface.
b) If it is refracted, calculate the angle of refraction (θ₂). If not, state that total internal reflection occurs.
