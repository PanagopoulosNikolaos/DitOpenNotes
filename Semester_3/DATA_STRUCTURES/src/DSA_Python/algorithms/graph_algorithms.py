GRAPH ALGORITHMS - Implementation

Advanced graph algorithms for shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and maximum flow.
These algorithms solve fundamental problems in network optimization and graph theory.

Algorithm Categories:
1. Shortest Path Algorithms:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Single-source shortest path (non-negative weights)
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Single-source shortest path (handles negative weights)
   
2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
   - Prim's Algorithm: Grows MST from starting vertex
   - Kruskal's Algorithm: Sorts edges and adds them greedily
   
3. Maximum Flow:
   - Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm: Finds maximum flow in network
   - Edmonds-Karp Algorithm: BFS-based implementation of Ford-Fulkerson

Common Use Cases:
- Shortest Path: GPS navigation, network routing, game AI
- MST: Network design, clustering, circuit design
- Maximum Flow: Network capacity, bipartite matching, resource allocation
